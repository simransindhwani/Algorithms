Each folder contains two files - index.js and test.js. Index.js is the solution to the problems and test.js contains the test cases considered. 

Use the commant "jest folder/test.js --watch" in command line to check whether the test cases satisfy. 

You can also use node index.js and make a function call internally inside index.js for simplicity.
